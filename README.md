Requested by Allison Dendy. The idea is to solder the mast to hole in the middle. The mast can be the common
(I'd be a little concerned if has the voltage but certainly a good idea for common-cathode signals where
the mast would be grounded). The mast and 7 other pads have holes for the signal leads and for the leads
of a CAT3, CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6 cable. Each lead has pads for an SMD resistor. the base will be buried in the 
roadbed or mounted under the layout. It could be mounted up or down as required.
